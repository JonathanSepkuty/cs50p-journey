This lecture explains exceptions 
exceptions refer to problems with your code (something gone wrong whch you should solve)
syntax error- entirely on you to solve can't expect other part of the code to solve for you
runtime error- be ready for something that is a bout to happen so you write a defensive line of code to be ready
ValueError: we used a wrong value type 
we program defensively so we code in a way called error handling-we have to think of problems before hand what if someone won't input an integer for example
try- check whether or not something exceptional happens
except- can i go and try to something except something goes wrong
see number.py example for use of try and except
we anticaipated a ValueError so we see "not an integer" instead of errorcode
we should strive to only use try one line of code that could result in an error (good practice) 
NameError-a variable or something isn't defined order of operations is flawed not in scope
else- can also be used for try and except blocks
pass-silently ignore (like in a gameshow you decide to pass on handling an error like a question)

if we hande an error the user wont know anything about it in the first place

we must have a vlock of code under except like: if,for,while,try because python needs to know "What do you want me to do when the error happens?"

except can be explained as such "If the code in the try block throws this specific kind of erroe do this instead 

try- try to run some risky code

continue- go back to the top of the loop/iteration
