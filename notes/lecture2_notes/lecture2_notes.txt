loops (do something again and again a cycle of sorts)
in meow.py flow chart in meows x 3 then stops
time consuming what if we want to meow 50,500 times or change to a bark

While- A construnct that allows us to do something again and again (boolean expression true or false)
"Do I have any fingers up (Am I done counting)
In first example i is always 3 so meow will always get printed (infinite loop) ctrl c for cancel
In second example while I does not equal 0 continue printing meow the when i becomes 0 meowing stops
Usually in CS it is accepted to start from 0 in that case we need to get to under 3 and not under equals 3
i +=1 (like i=i+1)

List- Another type of data a way of containing multiple values all in the same place/variable
For- Allows to itereate (to do (something) over again or repeatedly) over a list of items 
Square brackets [] rpresent a list
In first for list examples we're under the assumption that list will be 0-3 but in an extreme case of a larger list that code is not practical
range a function that gives a range of values
_ is a variable that we don't care about we're not using it later (pythonic)
escape sequence-\n (in print)
end method we can decide when we're moving on to next line
continue-stay in this loop
break-break out of this loop
We can purposefully induce an infinite loop until we get the value we want fom our user

In hogwarts example lets say i want to print a specific value from a list i use []
eg- print(students[0]) we're printing value in location 0
We can also use for loop if we don't know specific location (larger dataset)

len-short for length (range takes a list of integers but len takes a list of strings)
dict-dictionaries (allows to associate one value to another) associate something with something else like words with their definitions
eg to dict- students to thier house 
{} curly braces for dictionaries
two dimensions like a table 
when we use a for loop in a dictionary we get the keys not the attribute associated to the key
None-absense of a value
